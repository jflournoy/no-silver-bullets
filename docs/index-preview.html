<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Understanding factors that influence software development velocity is crucial for engineering teams and organizations, yet empirical evidence at scale remains limited. We analyze cycle time—a widely-used metric measuring time from ticket creation to completion—using a dataset of over 55,000 observations across 216 organizations. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling that appropriately separates individual and organizational variation, we examine how coding time, task scoping, and collaboration patterns affect cycle time while characterizing its substantial variability across contexts. We find precise but modest associations between cycle time and factors including coding days per week, number of merged pull requests, and degree of collaboration. However, these effects are set against considerable unexplained variation both between and within individuals. Our findings suggest that while common workplace factors do influence cycle time in expected directions, any single observation provides limited signal about typical performance. This work demonstrates methods for analyzing complex operational metrics at scale while highlighting potential pitfalls in using such measurements to drive decision-making. We conclude that improving software delivery velocity likely requires systems-level thinking rather than individual-focused interventions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Software Effort, Quality, and Cycle Time: A Study of CMM Level 5 Projects;,citation_abstract=The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) has become a popular methodology for improving software development processes with the goal of developing high-quality software within budget and planned cycle time. Prior research literature, while not exclusively focusing on CMM level 5 projects, has identified a host of factors as determinants of software development effort, quality, and cycle time. In this study, we focus exclusively on CMM level 5 projects from multiple organizations to study the impacts of highly mature processes on effort, quality, and cycle time. Using a linear regression model based on data collected from 37 CMM level 5 projects of four organizations, we find that high levels of process maturity, as indicated by CMM level 5 rating, reduce the effects of most factors that were previously believed to impact software development effort, quality, and cycle time. The only factor found to be significant in determining effort, cycle time, and quality was software size. On the average, the developed models predicted effort and cycle time around 12 percent and defects to about 49 percent of the actuals, across organizations. Overall, the results in this paper indicate that some of the biggest rewards from high levels of process maturity come from the reduction in variance of software development outcomes that were caused by factors other than software size;,citation_author=Manish Agrawal;,citation_author=Kaushal Chari;,citation_publication_date=2007-03;,citation_cover_date=2007-03;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1109/TSE.2007.29;,citation_issn=1939-3520;,citation_volume=33;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Pandora’s box of social, process, and people debts in software engineering;,citation_abstract=In software engineering, technical debt (TD) has been widely investigated, but debt regarding social issues, people, and processes has not been explored as much. It should be noted here that we use nontechnical debt (NTD) as an umbrella term to cover social, process, and people debts. Although the number of studies on NTD in software is increasing, the majority of them are descriptive rather than rigorous, and there is no systematic development of cumulative knowledge. As a result, identifying the fundamental causes of NTD and the associated mitigation techniques in software engineering is challenging. Therefore, this study investigates the scientific evidence regarding NTD till date by conducting a systematic mapping review of software engineering research between January 2000 and October 2021. The search strategy resulted in 175 studies, 17 of which were identified as unique and relevant primary papers. The primary studies show that NTD and TD are inextricably linked. In addition, this study also captured a plethora of causes and mitigation strategies for managing NTD and thus makes four important contributions: (i) highlighting state-of-the-art NTD research; (ii) identification of the reported causes and mitigation strategies in the primary papers; and (iii) determination of opportunities for future NTD research.;,citation_author=Muhammad Ovais Ahmad;,citation_author=Tomas Gustavsson;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1002/smr.2516;,citation_issn=2047-7481;,citation_volume=36;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Software: Evolution and Process;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Workplace surveillance: An overview;,citation_abstract=This article attempts to review the proliferation of research findings about surveillance in the workplace and the issues surrounding it. It establishes a number of points of departure when considering the issue of workplace surveillance, before reviewing some of the more critical issues. First, it establishes that organizations and surveillance go hand in hand; and that workplace surveillance can take social and technological forms. Personal data gathering, Internet and email monitoring, location tracking, biometrics and covert surveillance are all areas of development. There is also evidence that groups of employees are appropriating information and communication technologies to stare back at their employers, exposing unsavoury practices and organizing collectively, prompting new thinking about resistance. Organizations watch employees primarily to protect their assets, although the nature and intensity of surveillance says much about how a company views its employees. Workplace surveillance has consequences for employees, affecting employee well-being, work culture, productivity, creativity and motivation. If no alternative can be found, managerial attention to task design, supervisory processes, employees’ expectations about monitoring, and an appraisal of the company’s operating environment can mediate its downsides. It is argued that in many ways the normality of workplace surveillance, and the prevalence of arguments about how to “do it better”, make it difficult to radicalize. As part of what is seen as “good” management practice, it can confer benefits on the employee if conducted in a humane, balanced way, and is considered on a case-by-case–organization-by-organization–basis. However, the introduction of broader debates around information use, rights, power and social structure highlights how surveillance in the workplace may serve to perpetuate existing inequalities and create new ones.;,citation_author=Kirstie Ball;,citation_publication_date=2010-02;,citation_cover_date=2010-02;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/00236561003654776;,citation_issn=0023-656X;,citation_volume=51;,citation_journal_title=Labor History;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Technical debt cripples software developer productivity: A longitudinal study on developers’ daily software development work;,citation_abstract=Software companies need to continuously deliver customer value, both from a short- and long-term perspective. However, software development can be impeded by what has been described as Technical Debt (TD). The aim of this study is to explore the negative consequences of TD in terms of wasted software development time. This study also investigates on which additional activities this wasted time is spent and whether different types of TD impact the wasted time differently. This study also sets out to examine the benefits of tracking and communicating the amount of wasted time, both from a developer’s and manager’s perspective. This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study, surveying 43 software developers, together with follow-up interviews with 16 industrial software practitioners. The analysis of the reported wasted time revealed that developers waste, on average, 23% of their development time due to TD and that they are frequently forced to introduce new TD due to already existing TD. The most common activity on which additional time is spent is performing additional testing.;,citation_author=Terese Besker;,citation_author=Antonio Martini;,citation_author=Jan Bosch;,citation_publication_date=2018-05;,citation_cover_date=2018-05;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.1145/3194164.3194178;,citation_isbn=978-1-4503-5713-5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_conference_title=Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Technical Debt;,citation_conference=ACM;">

Additionally, designing, validating and improving metrics is an important research area. Although using software metrics can help in reaching goals, the effects of using metrics incorrectly can be devastating. In this tutorial we leverage 10 years of metrics-based risk assessment experience to illustrate the benefits of software metrics, discuss different types of metrics and explain typical usage scenario’s. Additionally, we explore various ways in which metrics can be interpreted using examples solicited from participants and practical assignments based on industry cases. During this process we will present the four common pitfalls of using software metrics. In particular, we explain why metrics should be placed in a context in order to maximize their benefits. A methodology based on benchmarking to provide such a context is discussed and illustrated by a model designed to quantify the technical quality of a software system. Examples of applying this model in industry are given and challenges involved in interpreting such a model are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Procedural fairness, outcome favorability, and judgments of an authority’s responsibility;,citation_abstract=Fairness theory (R. Folger &amp;amp;amp; R. Cropanzano, 1998, 2001) postulates that, particularly in the face of unfavorable outcomes, employees judge an organizational authority to be more responsible for their outcomes when the authority exhibits lower procedural fairness. Three studies lent empirical support to this notion. Furthermore, 2 of the studies showed that attributions of responsibility to the authority mediated the relationship between the authority’s procedural fairness and employees’ reactions to unfavorable outcomes. The findings (a) provide support for a key assumption of fairness theory, (b) help to account for the pervasive interactive effect of procedural fairness and outcome favorability on employees’ attitudes and behaviors, and (c) contribute to an emerging trend in justice research concerned with how people use procedural fairness information to make attributions of responsibility for their outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bayesian Item Response Modeling in R with brms and Stan;,citation_abstract=Item response theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons’ responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.;,citation_author=Paul-Christian Bürkner;,citation_publication_date=2021-11;,citation_cover_date=2021-11;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.18637/jss.v100.i05;,citation_issn=1548-7660;,citation_volume=100;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Statistical Software;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Perceived organizational support and employees’ well-being: The mediating role of organizational dehumanization;,citation_abstract=Perceived organizational support (POS) has been found to predict important organizational outcomes such as increasing employees’ well-being. In this research, we examine a new underlying mechanism of the relationship between POS and employees’ well-being, that is, employees’ perceptions that their organization dehumanizes them. This proposition was tested across two studies. Using an experimental design manipulating POS in a laboratory setting, Study 1 indicated that in the high POS condition, the subsequent feelings of being dehumanized by the organization were lower than in the low POS condition. More importantly, organizational dehumanization perceptions were found to mediate the POS condition and satisfaction link. Furthermore, using a sample of 1209 employees, results of Study 2 indicated that organizational dehumanization mediates the relationship between POS and three indicators of employees’ well-being (i.e., job satisfaction, emotional exhaustion, and psychosomatic strains). Implications for research on both organizational support theory and dehumanization theory are discussed.;,citation_author=Gaëtane Caesens;,citation_author=Florence Stinglhamber;,citation_author=Stéphanie Demoulin;,citation_author=Matthias De Wilde;,citation_publication_date=2017-07;,citation_cover_date=2017-07;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1080/1359432X.2017.1319817;,citation_issn=1359-432X;,citation_volume=26;,citation_journal_title=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cycle Time in Packaged Software Firms;,citation_abstract=Reduction of cycle time (i.e., time to market) is a fundamental competitive strategy in many industries. With the current proliferation of personal computer (PC) technology, software developers face intense competition. However, unlike their counterparts in other consumer goods markets, product development managers in the software industry appear to be less concerned with (or even aware of) cycle time than they are with other competitive variables. To explore the role of cycle-time reduction in the process of developing software packages, Erran Carmel conducted a study of 15 software package companies in the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan area. The survey results indicate that software package developers are generally unaware of cycle-time reduction as a management concept. Instead, software developers tend to focus on rapid development, with an emphasis on “crunch” periods of intense effort aimed at meeting a deadline. During these periods of peak activity, 87% of the developers in core teams worked more than 56 hours per week and 47% worked more than 71 hours per week. In terms of the organizational variables necessary for cycle-time reduction, all of the survey respondents point to the importance of a small, cohesive, core development team, similar to a cross-functional team. Members of the core team are entrepreneurial and share a common vision of the product’s design, use, and long-term direction. As for the development variables associated with cycle-time reduction, the software companies in the survey typically do not use process models or risk analysis techniques. Similarly, they devote scant resources to automated tools. For the majority of the firms in the survey, annual investment in automated software development tools is less than $1,000 per developer. On the other hand, reuse (as embodied in object-oriented design and development) and incremental innovation are important to all of the sample firms. Although quality assurance (QA) activities are not addressed in the innovation literature, QA is a significant cycle-time component in software development. As demonstrated by the industry practice of releasing products with long lists of known defects, the software product category clearly has quality problems. With the current boom in new users, pressure will grow for improved quality. To remain competitive, software developers need to determine how they can better integrate QA activities into the development process while reducing cycle time.;,citation_author=Erran Carmel;,citation_publication_date=1995;,citation_cover_date=1995;,citation_year=1995;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1540-5885.1995.jpim122_0110.xml.x;,citation_issn=1540-5885;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Product Innovation Management;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Disaggregation of Within-Person and Between-Person Effects in Longitudinal Models of Change;,citation_abstract=Longitudinal models are becoming increasingly prevalent in the behavioral sciences, with key advantages including increased power, more comprehensive measurement, and establishment of temporal precedence. One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a time-varying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.;,citation_author=Patrick J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Predicting Expert Evaluations in Software Code Reviews;,citation_abstract=Manual code reviews are an essential but time-consuming part of software development, often leading reviewers to prioritize technical issues while skipping valuable assessments. This paper presents an algorithmic model that automates aspects of code review typically avoided due to their complexity or subjectivity, such as assessing coding time, implementation time, and code complexity. Instead of replacing manual reviews, our model adds insights that help reviewers focus on more impactful tasks. Calibrated using expert evaluations, the model predicts key metrics from code commits with strong correlations to human judgments (r = 0.82 for coding time, r = 0.86 for implementation time). By automating these assessments, we reduce the burden on human reviewers and ensure consistent analysis of time-consuming areas, offering a scalable solution alongside manual reviews. This research shows how automated tools can enhance code reviews by addressing overlooked tasks, supporting data-driven decisions and improving the review process.;,citation_author=Yegor Denisov-Blanch;,citation_author=Igor Ciobanu;,citation_author=Simon Obstbaum;,citation_author=Michal Kosinski;,citation_publication_date=2024-09;,citation_cover_date=2024-09;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15152;,citation_doi=10.48550/arXiv.2409.15152;,citation_publisher=arXiv;">

The magnitude of this shift and the factors that have accompanied this new unplanned work setting go beyond what the software engineering community has previously understood to be remote work. To find out how developers and their productivity were affected, we distributed two surveys (with a combined total of 3,634 responses that answered all required questions) weeks apart to understand the presence and prevalence of the benefits, challenges, and opportunities to improve this special circumstance of remote work. From our thematic qualitative analysis and statistical quantitative analysis, we find that there is a dichotomy of developer experiences influenced by many different factors (that for some are a benefit, while for others a challenge). For example, a benefit for some was being close to family members but for others having family members share their working space and interrupting their focus, was a challenge. Our surveys led to powerful narratives from respondents and revealed the scale at which these experiences exist to provide insights as to how the future of (pandemic) remote work can evolve.;,citation_author=Denae Ford;,citation_author=Margaret-Anne Storey;,citation_author=Thomas Zimmermann;,citation_author=Christian Bird;,citation_author=Sonia Jaffe;,citation_author=Chandra Maddila;,citation_author=Jenna L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Guidelines for including grey literature and conducting multivocal literature reviews in software engineering;,citation_abstract=Context A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts, videos and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results. Objective There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences.;,citation_author=Vahid Garousi;,citation_author=Michael Felderer;,citation_author=Mika V.

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.;,citation_author=Andrew Gelman;,citation_author=John Carlin;,citation_publication_date=2014-11;,citation_cover_date=2014-11;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1177/1745691614551642;,citation_issn=1745-6916, 1745-6924;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Perspectives on Psychological Science;">

Unfortunately, some of the companies changing their development processes do so without any a priori basis for determining whether the process change will have helped or hindered them. The firm implements the new process without having a cycle time performance baseline against which to compare results from the new process.

This paper aims to provide an interdisciplinary introduction to underappreciated elements of developers’ communal, social cognition which are required for software development creativity and problem-solving, either empowering or constraining the solutions that developers access and implement. We propose that despite a conventional emphasis on individualistic explanations, developers’ problem-solving (and hence, many of the central innovation cycles in software) is better described as a cumulative culture where collective social learning (rather than solitary and isolated genius) plays a key role in the transmission of solutions, the scaffolding of individual productivity, and the overall velocity of innovation.;,citation_author=Catherine M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The New Developer: AI Skill Threat, Identity Change &amp;amp;amp; Developer Thriving in the Transition to AI-Assisted Software Development;,citation_abstract=In this research study, we share original empirical research with 3000+ software engineers and developers across 12+ industries engaged in the transition to Generative AI-assisted software work. We bring a human-centered approach to pressing questions that engineering organizations are facing on the rapidly-changing possibilities of AI-assisted coding. How are developers impacted by changing demands on their roles? Where might there be emerging equity &amp;amp;amp; opportunity gaps in who has access to these new development capabilities? What are the risks to the quality of technical work, and the developer productivity, thriving, and motivation which drive that technical work? From this work we present a new evidence-based framework to help developers, engineering managers, and leaders as they grapple with failure to thrive in the transition to AI-assisted work: AI Skill Threat. AI Skill Threat describes developers’ fear, anxiety, and worry that their current skills will quickly become obsolete as they adapt to AI-assisted coding. Our framework also predicts when and why AI Skill Threat emerges: engineers who maintain a strong belief in competition and the demonstration of “innate brilliance” are more likely to report AI Skill Threat. However, engineers who report the presence of learning cultures and belonging are less likely to report AI Skill Threat. Finally, we document new and emerging equity and opportunity gaps for software teams adopting new tooling practices. AI Skill Threat is higher for Racially Minoritized developers, who also rate the overall quality of AI-assisted coding outputs significantly lower. Both female developers and LGBTQ+ developers were significantly less likely to report plans to upskilling for new AI-assisted workflows. These and other emerging differences point toward a critical need to understand how organizations ensure that AI-assisted coding adoption is equitable and accessible, and that key insights from developers with important perspectives on the risks of AI-assisted coding are heard.;,citation_author=Catherine M.

However, there is still a limited understanding of how SE research is taking advantage of GL. Objective: This research aimed to understand how SE researchers use GL in their secondary studies. Methods: We conducted a tertiary study of studies published between 2011 and 2018 in high-quality software engineering conferences and journals. We then applied qualitative and quantitative analysis to investigate 446 potential studies. Results: From the 446 selected studies, 126 studies cited GL but only 95 of those used GL to answer a specific research question representing almost 21% of all the 446 secondary studies. Interestingly, we identified that few studies employed specific search mechanisms and used additional criteria for assessing GL. Moreover, by the time we conducted this research, 49% of the GL URLs are not working anymore. Based on our findings, we discuss some challenges in using GL and potential mitigation plans. Conclusion: In this paper, we summarized the last 10 years of software engineering research that uses GL, showing that GL has been essential for bringing practical new perspectives that are scarce in traditional literature.

Organizational dehumanization (OD), defined as employees’ perceptions of being treated as mere tools by their organization, has been shown to negatively affect employees and organizations. To explain such detrimental effects, scholars have argued that OD might thwart employees’ fundamental psychological needs. Yet, evidence of this mechanism remains empirically nonexistent. Filling this gap, this research aims at investigating the mediating role of psychological need thwarting in the relationships between OD and employees’ well-being and attitudes. Based on a cross-sectional study (N = 340) and a two-wave study (3 months apart; N = 603), the results indicate that OD thwarts employees’ psychological needs which are, in turn, negatively related to their well-being (psychological strains, absenteeism, and job satisfaction) and attitudes (turnover intentions and affective commitment).;,citation_author=Constantin Lagios;,citation_author=Gaëtane Caesens;,citation_author=Nathan Nguyen;,citation_author=Florence Stinglhamber;,citation_publication_date=2022-04;,citation_cover_date=2022-04;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1027/1866-5888/a000286;,citation_issn=1866-5888;,citation_volume=21;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Personnel Psychology;,citation_publisher=Hogrefe Publishing;">

Methodology: Using a card sort, we explored how a Three Layer Productivity Framework was used by 16 software engineers at a Software Engineering focused conference to rank measures of success, first in the current practice of their organization and second in their individual beliefs about the best ways to measure engineering success. Results and discussion: Overall, participants preferred organizations to 1) continue their prioritized focus on performance layer metrics, 2) increase the focus on productivity metrics, and 3) decrease their focus on production metrics. When asked about the current metrics of their organizations, while all roles reported a current focus on performance metrics, only ICs reported a strong focus on production metrics. When asked about metrics they would prefer, all roles preferred more performance metrics but only leaders and ICs also wanted productivity metrics. While all participants were aligned on performance metrics being a top preference, there was misalignment on which specific metrics are used. Our findings show that when measuring developer success, organizations should continue measurement using performance metrics, consider an increased focus on productivity metrics, and consider a decreased focus on production metrics.;,citation_author=Carol S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model Mis-Specification Analyses of Weibull and Gamma Models Based on One-Shot Device Test Data;,citation_abstract=Model mis-specification is of great importance in reliability assessment. Different choices of probability models for fitting data may result in substantially different inferential results on some lifetime characteristics of interest. Gamma and Weibull models have been used extensively for modeling lifetime data. Hence, accelerated life models have been developed recently for one-shot device test data under both these models for making inference on mean lifetime as well as the reliability at use level. However, model mis-specification analyses between these two models have not been studied in this context. Here, we examine the effect of model mis-specification between gamma and Weibull models on the likelihood estimation and the inference on the mean lifetime and the reliability at some mission times based on one-shot device test data. Moreover, a distance-based test statistic and the Akaike information criterion as specification tests are studied for the purpose of model validation. A simulation study is carried out to evaluate the bias and coverage probabilities of confidence intervals under model mis-specification. The obtained results reveal that the effect of model mis-specification is negligible only when the sample size is small and when the accelerated and use levels are close, and that the use of specification test is quite important for an accurate reliability assessment.;,citation_author=Man Ho Ling;,citation_author=Narayanaswamy Balakrishnan;,citation_publication_date=2017-09;,citation_cover_date=2017-09;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1109/TR.2017.2703111;,citation_issn=1558-1721;,citation_volume=66;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Reliability;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Today Was a Good Day: The Daily Life of Software Developers;,citation_abstract=What is a good workday for a software developer? What is a typical workday? We seek to answer these two questions to learn how to make good days typical. Concretely, answering these questions will help to optimize development processes and select tools that increase job satisfaction and productivity. Our work adds to a large body of research on how software developers spend their time. We report the results from 5971 responses of professional developers at Microsoft, who reflected about what made their workdays good and typical, and self-reported about how they spent their time on various activities at work. We developed conceptual frameworks to help define and characterize developer workdays from two new perspectives: good and typical. Our analysis confirms some findings in previous work, including the fact that developers actually spend little time on development and developers’ aversion for meetings and interruptions. It also discovered new findings, such as that only 1.7% of survey responses mentioned emails as a reason for a bad workday, and that meetings and interruptions are only unproductive during development phases; during phases of planning, specification and release, they are common and constructive. One key finding is the importance of agency, developers’ control over their workday and whether it goes as planned or is disrupted by external factors. We present actionable recommendations for researchers and managers to prioritize process and tool improvements that make good workdays typical. For instance, in light of our finding on the importance of agency, we recommend that, where possible, managers empower developers to choose their tools and tasks.;,citation_author=Andre N.

Our results suggest that the factors that most strongly correlate with self-rated productivity were non-technical factors, such as job enthusiasm, peer support for new ideas, and receiving useful feedback about job performance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of Budget and Schedule Pressure on Software Development Cycle Time and Effort;,citation_abstract=As excessive budget and schedule compression becomes the norm in today’s software industry, an understanding of its impact on software development performance is crucial for effective management strategies. Previous software engineering research has implied a nonlinear impact of schedule pressure on software development outcomes. Borrowing insights from organizational studies, we formalize the effects of budget and schedule pressure on software cycle time and effort as U-shaped functions. The research models were empirically tested with data from a 25 billion/year international technology firm, where estimation bias is consciously minimized and potential confounding variables are properly tracked. We found that controlling for software process, size, complexity, and conformance quality, budget pressure, a less researched construct, has significant U-shaped relationships with development cycle time and development effort. On the other hand, contrary to our prediction, schedule pressure did not display significant nonlinear impact on development outcomes. A further exploration of the sampled projects revealed that the involvement of clients in the software development might have “eroded” the potential benefits of schedule pressure. This study indicates the importance of budget pressure in software development. Meanwhile, it implies that achieving the potential positive effect of schedule pressure requires cooperation between clients and software development teams.;,citation_author=Ning Nan;,citation_author=Donald E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Multivocal literature reviews in software engineering: Preliminary findings from a tertiary study;,citation_abstract=Background: In recent years, studies involving Grey Literature (GL) have been growing and attracting the attention of researchers in software engineering (SE). One of the sources of GL refers to content produced by professionals based on their practical experiences? Recent researches in the SE states that GL can complement areas of research that are not yet clearly defined in the scientific literature. In this context, the Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), a form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the inclusion of GL, emerges. Goal: Provide preliminary work about the current research involving MLR studies? First, we investigate the motivation of the researchers to include GL in review studies; and second, we examine how GL was included in the studies. Method: A tertiary study was conducted to search MLR studies published between 2009 to April of 2019. Results: The main motivations for including GL in review studies are: lack of academic research on the topic, emerging research on this topic, and complementary evidence in the GL? Internet articles and white papers were the main sources of GL data used. Conclusions: The conducting of MLR studies is still in its early stages; we have identified only 12 secondary studies. The MLR studies were conducted using guidelines for performing SLRs. What we consider to be a threat to the validity of these studies, since guidelines to conduct SLR studies do not provide recommendations for quality analysis and synthesis of primary studies, including GL.;,citation_author=Geraldo Torres G.

They provide support for defining quality attributes, building and measuring the quality of the resulting product. Each quality model adopts a critical view on quality in terms of a set of model elements and relationships between them. This study aims to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art research on quality models with a focus on encompassing model elements and their support to architecting quality. The study was conducted using systematic mapping as the research methodology. A total of 238 primary papers were classified based on the type of research, standards usage, and publication trends. We identified that 17% (40) of papers belong to quality models. These 40 models were analyzed for the underlying meta-model elements and their support for a quality architecture using Bayer’s reference architecture framework. The architecture phase mapping analysis shows that quality planning phase is 100% supported, quality assessment is 75% supported, quality documentation is included in 40% models and quality realization aspect is barely considered in 13% models. Quality realization happens through software processes and patterns, and it is necessary to evolve quality models and software process architectures that correlate quality definitions and quality realization mechanisms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards Measuring the Impact of Technical Debt on Lead Time: An Industrial Case Study;,citation_abstract=Objective: We conduct an empirical study investigating whether technical debt impacts lead time in resolving Jira issues. Furthermore, our aim is to measure the extent to which variance in lead time is explainable by the technical debt. Method: We conducted an industrial case study to examine the relationship in six components, each of which was analyzed individually. Technical debt was measured using SonarQube and normalized with the component’s size, while lead time to resolve Jira issues was collected directly from Jira. Results: We found a set of mixed results. Technical debt had a moderate positive impact on lead time in two components, while we did not see a meaningful impact on two others. A moderate negative impact was found in the remaining two components. Conclusion: The findings show that technical debt alone can not explain all the variance in lead time, which ranges from 5% up to 41% across components. So, there should be some other variables (e.g., size of the changes made, complexity, number of teams involved, component ownership) impacting lead time, or it might have a residual effect that might manifest later on. Further investigation into those confounding variables is essential.;,citation_author=Bhuwan Paudel;,citation_author=Javier Gonzalez-Huerta;,citation_author=Ehsan Zabardast;,citation_author=Eriks Klotins;,citation_publication_date=2024-06;,citation_cover_date=2024-06;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01578;,citation_doi=10.48550/arXiv.2406.01578;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_publisher=arXiv;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Mark of a Woman’s Record: Gender and Academic Performance in Hiring;,citation_abstract=Women earn better grades than men across levels of education—but to what end? This article assesses whether men and women receive equal returns to academic performance in hiring. I conducted an audit study by submitting 2,106 job applications that experimentally manipulated applicants’ GPA, gender, and college major. Although GPA matters little for men, women benefit from moderate achievement but not high achievement. As a result, high-achieving men are called back significantly more often than high-achieving women—at a rate of nearly 2-to-1. I further find that high-achieving women are most readily penalized when they major in math: high-achieving men math majors are called back three times as often as their women counterparts. A survey experiment conducted with 261 hiring decision-makers suggests that these patterns are due to employers’ gendered standards for applicants. Employers value competence and commitment among men applicants, but instead privilege women applicants who are perceived as likeable. This standard helps moderate-achieving women, who are often described as sociable and outgoing, but hurts high-achieving women, whose personalities are viewed with more skepticism. These findings suggest that achievement invokes gendered stereotypes that penalize women for having good grades, creating unequal returns to academic performance at labor market entry.;,citation_author=Natasha Quadlin;,citation_publication_date=2018-04;,citation_cover_date=2018-04;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1177/0003122418762291;,citation_issn=0003-1224;,citation_volume=83;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=American Sociological Review;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systems Perspective on Technical Debt;,citation_abstract=This paper explores applications of the Technical Debt metaphor, which originated in the agile software community, at a systems level. We present a summary of current understanding of the technical debt concept and propose a broader application of the approach at a system level. The technical debt metaphor provides a method to identify cases when design or implementation decisions are being made for expediency and assess their long term impact on productivity and risk. In addition, technical debt management offers a logical approach to tracking expedient decisions and determining when it makes sense to carry the debt and when it’s better to pay it off by updating designed and retrofitting units. In this paper, we describe various kinds of technical debt that may be present in a system baseline and consider how the presence of debt impacts further evolution of the system. Types of debt include architectural debt, configuration debt, testing debt and deprecation debt among others. We also present use case studies that illustrate how technical debt assessment and management can have a positive impact on system realization. Cases include moving a baseline from R&amp;amp;amp;D to operations, reusing a baseline in a new context, and planning a technical refresh. We discuss methods of managing technical debt in a baseline including identification, quantification, tracking and payoff.;,citation_author=Larri Ann Rosser;,citation_author=John H Norton;,citation_publication_date=2021-03;,citation_cover_date=2021-03;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438359;,citation_issn=1095-323X;,citation_conference_title=2021 IEEE Aerospace Conference (50100);">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing practitioner beliefs about software engineering;,citation_abstract=Software engineering is a highly dynamic discipline. Hence, as times change, so too might our beliefs about core processes in this field. This paper checks some five beliefs that originated in the past decades that comment on the relationships between (i) developer productivity; (ii) software quality and (iii) years of developer experience. Using data collected from 1,356 developers in the period 1995 to 2006, we found support for only one of the five beliefs titled “Quality entails productivity.” We found no clear support for four other beliefs based on programming languages and software developers. However, from the sporadic evidence of the four other beliefs, we learned that a narrow scope could delude practitioners in misinterpreting certain effects to hold in their day-to-day work. Lastly, through an aggregated view of assessing the five beliefs, we find programming languages act as a confounding factor for developer productivity and software quality. Thus the overall message of this work is that it is both important and possible to revisit old beliefs in software engineering. Researchers and practitioners should routinely retest old beliefs.;,citation_author=N. C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards a Theory of Software Developer Job Satisfaction and Perceived Productivity;,citation_abstract=Developer satisfaction and work productivity are important considerations for software companies. Enhanced developer satisfaction may improve the attraction, retention and health of employees, while higher productivity should reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction through faster software improvements. Many researchers and companies assume that perceived productivity and job satisfaction are related and may be used as proxies for one another, but these claims are a current topic of debate. There are also many social and technical factors that may impact satisfaction and productivity, but which factors have the most impact is not clear, especially for specific development contexts. Through our research, we developed a theory articulating a bidirectional relationship between software developer job satisfaction and perceived productivity, and identified what additional social and technical factors, challenges and work context variables influence this relationship. The constructs and relationships in our theory were derived in part from related literature in software engineering and knowledge work, and we validated and extended these concepts through a rigorously designed survey instrument. We instantiate our theory with a large software company, which suggests a number of propositions about the relative impact of various factors and challenges on developer satisfaction and perceived productivity. Our survey instrument and analysis approach can be applied to other development settings, while our findings lead to concrete recommendations for practitioners and researchers.;,citation_author=Margaret-Anne Storey;,citation_author=Thomas Zimmermann;,citation_author=Christian Bird;,citation_author=Jacek Czerwonka;,citation_author=Brendan Murphy;,citation_author=Eirini Kalliamvakou;,citation_publication_date=2021-10;,citation_cover_date=2021-10;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1109/TSE.2019.2944354;,citation_issn=0098-5589, 1939-3520, 2326-3881;,citation_volume=47;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering;">

The productivity of software production processes may vary across development contexts dependent on numerous influencing factors. Effective productivity management requires considering these factors. Yet, there are thousands of possible factors and considering all of them would make no sense from the economical point of view. Therefore, productivity modeling should focus on a limited number of factors with the most significant impact on productivity. In this chapter, we present a comprehensive overview of productivity factors recently considered by software practitioners. The study results are based on the review of 126 publications as well as international experiences of the Fraunhofer Institute, including the most recent 13 industrial projects, four workshops, and eight surveys on software productivity. The aggregated results show that the productivity of software development processes still depends significantly on the capabilities of developers as well as on the tools and methods they use.;,citation_author=Adam Trendowicz;,citation_author=Jürgen Münch;,citation_publication_date=2009-01;,citation_cover_date=2009-01;,citation_year=2009;,citation_doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(09)01206-6;,citation_volume=77;,citation_inbook_title=Advances in Computers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Examining the Impact of Self-Admitted Technical Debt on Software Quality;,citation_abstract=Technical debt refers to incomplete or temporary workarounds that allow us to speed software development in the short term at the cost of paying a higher price later on. Recently, studies have shown that technical debt can be detected from source code comments, referred to as self-admitted technical debt. Researchers have examined the detection, classification and removal of self-admitted technical debt. However, to date there is no empirical evidence on the impact of self-admitted technical debt on software quality. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the relation between self-admitted technical debt and software quality by investigating whether (i) files with self-admitted technical debt have more defects compared to files without self-admitted technical debt, (ii) whether self-admitted technical debt changes introduce future defects, and (iii) whether self-admitted technical debt-related changes tend to be more difficult. We measured the difficulty of a change using well-known measures proposed in prior work such as the amount of churn, the number of files, the number of modified modules in a change, as well as the entropy of a change. An empirical study using five open source projects, namely Hadoop, Chromium, Cassandra, Spark and Tomcat, showed that: (i) there is no clear trend when it comes to defects and self-admitted technical debt, although the defectiveness of the technical debt files increases after the introduction of technical debt, (ii) self-admitted technical debt changes induce less future defects than none technical debt changes, however, (iii) self-admitted technical debt changes are more difficult to perform, i.e., they are more complex. Our study indicates that although technical debt may have negative effects, its impact is not only related to defects, rather making the system more difficult to change in the future.;,citation_author=Sultan Wehaibi;,citation_author=Emad Shihab;,citation_author=Latifa Guerrouj;,citation_publication_date=2016-03;,citation_cover_date=2016-03;,citation_year=2016;,citation_doi=10.1109/SANER.2016.72;,citation_volume=1;,citation_conference_title=2016 IEEE 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER);">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R, Second Edition;,citation_abstract=The first edition of this book has established itself as one of the leading references on generalized additive models (GAMs), and the only book on the topic to be introductory in nature with a wealth of practical examples and software implementation. It is self-contained, providing the necessary background in linear models, linear mixed models, and generalized linear models (GLMs), before presenting a balanced treatment of the theory and applications of GAMs and related models. The author bases his approach on a framework of penalized regression splines, and while firmly focused on the practical aspects of GAMs, discussions include fairly full explanations of the theory underlying the methods. Use of R software helps explain the theory and illustrates the practical application of the methodology. Each chapter contains an extensive set of exercises, with solutions in an appendix or in the book’s R data package gamair, to enable use as a course text or for self-study. Simon N.

This study combined longitudinal prospective and experience sampling methods to examine the relationship between happiness and self-reported productivity among Directors employed in the public and private sectors. Analyses at a trait level suggested happy people were more productive. Similarly, at the state level of analysis, people were more productive when they were happier. Among the happiness indicators examined (job satisfaction, quality of work life, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect) positive affect was most strongly, but not exclusively, tied to productivity at both the state and trait levels. Discussion focuses on reconciling a long history of mixed findings regarding the happy-productive worker thesis.;,citation_author=John M. Zelenski;,citation_author=Steven A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pull request latency explained: An empirical overview;,citation_abstract=Pull request latency evaluation is an essential application of effort evaluation in the pullbased development scenario. It can help the reviewers sort the pull request queue, remind developers about the review processing time, speed up the review process and accelerate software development. There is a lack of work that systematically organizes the factors that affect pull request latency. Also, there is no related work discussing the differences and variations in characteristics in different scenarios and contexts. In this paper, we collected relevant factors through a literature review approach. Then we assessed their relative importance in five scenarios and six different contexts using the mixed-effects linear regression model. The most important factors differ in different scenarios. The length of the description is most important when pull requests are submitted. The existence of comments is most important when closing pull requests, using CI tools, and when the contributor and the integrator are different. When there exist comments, the latency of the first comment is the most important. Meanwhile, the influence of factors may change in different contexts. For example, the number of commits in a pull request has a more significant impact on pull request latency when closing than submitting due to changes in contributions brought about by the review process. Both human and bot comments are positively correlated with pull request latency. In contrast, the bot’s first comments are more strongly correlated with latency, but the number of comments is less correlated. Future research and tool implementation needs to consider the impact of different contexts. Researchers can conduct related studies based on our publicly available datasets and replication scripts.;,citation_author=Xunhui Zhang;,citation_author=Yue Yu;,citation_author=Tao Wang;,citation_author=Ayushi Rastogi;,citation_author=Huaimin Wang;,citation_publication_date=2022-11;,citation_cover_date=2022-11;,citation_year=2022;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10664-022-10143-4;,citation_issn=1382-3256, 1573-7616;,citation_volume=27;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Empirical Software Engineering;">

        <p>Understanding factors that influence software development velocity is crucial for engineering teams and organizations, yet empirical evidence at scale remains limited. We analyze cycle time—a widely-used metric measuring time from ticket creation to completion—using a dataset of over 55,000 observations across 216 organizations. Through Bayesian hierarchical modeling that appropriately separates individual and organizational variation, we examine how coding time, task scoping, and collaboration patterns affect cycle time while characterizing its substantial variability across contexts. We find precise but modest associations between cycle time and factors including coding days per week, number of merged pull requests, and degree of collaboration. However, these effects are set against considerable unexplained variation both between and within individuals. Our findings suggest that while common workplace factors do influence cycle time in expected directions, any single observation provides limited signal about typical performance. This work demonstrates methods for analyzing complex operational metrics at scale while highlighting potential pitfalls in using such measurements to drive decision-making. We conclude that improving software delivery velocity likely requires systems-level thinking rather than individual-focused interventions.</p>

<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>Understanding the factors that affect the delivery of software at an organizational level offers businesses and engineering teams the knowledge to deliver value to users, maintain competitiveness, and improve developer experience. Given engineering teams’ fundamental role in software delivery, the velocity of their work—that is, the time it takes for task completion—has emerged as a focal point of empirical investigation, particularly through measures like cycle time which captures the duration between ticket opening and ticket closing. Moreover, cycle-time is seen by engineers as the most useful metric of engineering productivity according to a prominent industry report <span class="citation" data-cites="careyWhy70Engineers2024">(<a href="#ref-careyWhy70Engineers2024" role="doc-biblioref">Carey 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>While cycle time is often treated as an indicator of productivity per se, the concept of productivity remains poorly specified in software engineering contexts, where outputs fundamentally differ from the more readily quantifiable measures used in traditional industrial production. Specific units of work are rarely identical across time for a person, within a team, or across teams. The interpretation of cycle time therefore presents particular challenges because variations could reflect differences in work patterns, task assignment, and organizational contexts rather than differences in some underlying rate of task completion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the intuitive appeal of cycle time and its widespread use in practice make it a valuable focus for empirical investigation. The above-mentioned complexities necessitate sophisticated statistical methods to detect the unique impact of multiple factors, while carefully characterizing the variability practitioners can expect in day-to-day and month-to-month observations of cycle time. Through rigorous statistical modeling of longitudinal data across multiple organizations, we can both characterize its variability across real-world contexts, while demonstrating methodological approaches for analyzing such complex operational metrics. This analysis also allows us to detect systematic influences from factors commonly believed to affect developer productivity: task scoping, focused work time, collaboration, and time of year.</p>
<p>Our investigation leverages a unique dataset comprising over 11,398 contributors at 216 organizations across diverse industries. This work makes two primary contributions. First, we demonstrate a model for statistically investigating software activity data at both a larger and more longitudinal scale than previous empirical research, allowing us to characterize how cycle time varies across software development contexts (i.e., individuals, organizations, and variable process factors), using hierarchical modeling that appropriately separates individual and organizational variation, combined with the careful disaggregation of within- and between-person effects. This approach allows us both greater precision and nuance in describing effects as well as the ability to highlight potential pitfalls in using such measurements to drive decision-making. Second, we incorporate these multiple measures of process factors simultaneously to isolate unique effects, including a novel measure of collaboration operationalized as degree centrality, taking initial steps toward reflecting the impact of the interactive nature of software development in large-scale analyses of activity data.</p>
<p>Our research questions are:</p>
<p>RQ1. How do common workplace and software development process factors impact cycle time?</p>
<p>RQ2. How much between- and within-person variation is there in cycle time?</p>
<p>The paper proceeds as follows: We first review the literature on software productivity measurement, examining cycle time’s relationship to broader discussions of developer performance. We then present our methodology for analyzing cycle time variation using Bayesian hierarchical linear models. Our results examine both population-level effects and the substantial variation observed between individuals and organizations. We conclude by discussing implications for practice and future research directions.</p>

<p>The use of cycle time in the academic and industry literature is almost always as part of a discussion of productivity. This may be in part because cycle time and related metrics are one of the only so-called objective quantitative windows we have into the process of software production (but note that self-reports of perceived productivity are also potentially valid measures of this process). For this reason, it behooves us to discuss the literature on productivity, even as we position this analysis as specifically analyzing what we consider to be at best a very distal indicator of whatever it is people mean when they use the word “productivity.”</p>
<p>Defining software team productivity and performance is a highly contentious exercise and many different definitions are given by both practitioners and researchers <span class="citation" data-cites="fraserNoSilverBullet2007 hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023 hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2024 murphy-hillWhatPredictsSoftware2021 sadowskiSoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2019">(<a href="#ref-fraserNoSilverBullet2007" role="doc-biblioref">Fraser et al. 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023" role="doc-biblioref">C.

Perceptions of what counts as successful software work can meaningfully differ across individuals and roles, as when engineering managers tend to focus on long-term outcomes and individual developers focus on activity, for example <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023 storeyHowDevelopersManagers2022b">(<a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023" role="doc-biblioref">C.

Across workplaces, measures of time have been frequently used to assess productivity even while the shortcomings of these measures are also widely acknowledged <span class="citation" data-cites="griffinMetricsMeasuringProduct1993">(<a href="#ref-griffinMetricsMeasuringProduct1993" role="doc-biblioref">Griffin 1993</a>)</span>.

These have obvious limitations in that the meaning of a particular unit for any of these metrics may be different depending on context <span class="citation" data-cites="sadowskiSoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2019">(<a href="#ref-sadowskiSoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2019" role="doc-biblioref">Sadowski, Storey, and Feldt 2019</a>)</span>.

Hicks, Lee, and Ramsey 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-storeyTheorySoftwareDeveloper2021" role="doc-biblioref">Storey et al. 2021</a>)</span>. While it is plausible that perceived productivity could be a good indicator of productivity, it is still not free of the context effects that are often levied as critiques of more “objective” metrics, and self-report, while perhaps overcoming some shortcomings of other methods, bring with them another set of measurement issues.</p>
<p>The difficulty of quantifying productivity arises even prior to the step of choosing one or several indicators. There is often a lack of clear distinction between production (quantity of output regardless of resources provided), productivity (quantity of output given the resources provided), and performance (flexibility, adaptability, dependability, sustainability, and quality of output over time) <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023">(<a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023" role="doc-biblioref">C. Hicks, Lee, and Ramsey 2023</a>)</span>. As any software developer will be aware, this conceptual complexity is likely the result of the various ways their work counts for professional development, for the success of the product, and for simply meeting deadlines. This piece of research does not aim to solve the issue of how we conceive of productivity but instead seeks to take a deep look at a single popular metric in order to showcase, first, the many factors (themselves, a subset of possible influences of productivity) that affect cycle time, and second, how observing this metric over time informs our view of the ways cycle time varies both within and between people. These views will be helpful both to illuminate specific properties of cycle time as a measure but also to demonstrate how one might approach an in-depth analysis of either “objective” or self-report metrics of productivity.</p>

<p>Likewise, scholarship on employee perceptions of organizational and procedural justice have long documented that when employees perceive a context of organizational injustice, this can exacerbate or redefine experiences of organizational decision-making and performance evaluations <span class="citation" data-cites="brocknerInteractiveEffectsProcedural1994 brocknerProceduralFairnessOutcome2007">(<a href="#ref-brocknerInteractiveEffectsProcedural1994" role="doc-biblioref">Brockner et al. 1994</a>, <a href="#ref-brocknerProceduralFairnessOutcome2007" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>. Given such larger organizational dynamics, it is likely that whether or not software metrics adoptions are successful is impacted not only by the choice of metric but also by larger contextual factors such as teams’ sociocognitive experiences and expectations around measurement, and the psychological affordances of their environments which may or may not allow them to address measurement concerns <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksPsychologicalAffordancesCan2024">(<a href="#ref-hicksPsychologicalAffordancesCan2024" role="doc-biblioref">C.

<p>We lack holistic evidence about what practitioners in software development believe about developer performance and ability; some reports from researchers with samples at large technology companies have suggested both that definitions of productivity can vary widely between managers and developers, and that software developers perceive many potential trade-offs between types of technical goals, e.g.&nbsp;that quality and speed may be unattainable together <span class="citation" data-cites="storeyHowDevelopersManagers2022">(<a href="#ref-storeyHowDevelopersManagers2022" role="doc-biblioref">Storey, Houck, and Zimmermann 2022a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>One “industry myth” which is referenced frequently in practitioner commentary is the idea of a “10x engineer”: this position alleges that some small outlier population of software developers consistently outperform others on key development tasks. Potentially springing from small case studies examining a handful of developers’ time spent solving small laboratory tasks <span class="citation" data-cites="sackmanExploratoryExperimentalStudies1968 nicholsEndMythIndividual2019">(<a href="#ref-sackmanExploratoryExperimentalStudies1968" role="doc-biblioref">Sackman, Erikson, and Grant 1968</a>; discussed in <a href="#ref-nicholsEndMythIndividual2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nichols 2019</a>)</span>, this “law” was generalized from only twelve individuals, uses time spent on the tasks as an estimate of both effort and cost, has failed to replicate in larger examinations of developer performance on similar tasks, and failed to acknowledge large within-individual variation in task performance <span class="citation" data-cites="nicholsEndMythIndividual2019 shrikanthAssessingPractitionerBeliefs2021">(<a href="#ref-nicholsEndMythIndividual2019" role="doc-biblioref">Nichols 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-shrikanthAssessingPractitionerBeliefs2021" role="doc-biblioref">Shrikanth et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the idea that “10x engineers” exist and that some individuals in software engineering outperform others by a “rule” of 10x has been cited often and codified in industry commentary, <span class="citation" data-cites="brooksMythicalManmonthEssays1975">(e.g., <a href="#ref-brooksMythicalManmonthEssays1975" role="doc-biblioref">Brooks 1975</a>)</span>. Modern commentary on this idea frequently refers to it as a myth, but it is also discussed as a potentially real phenomenon<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In our previous work, we have noted that some software practitioners hold field-specific ability beliefs that software development success and productivity is attributable to a quality of “innate brilliance”, and that this belief among practitioners may create a higher likelihood of experiencing threat and anxiety in the face of rapid role change and technological shifts to developer workflows <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksNewDeveloperAI2024">(<a href="#ref-hicksNewDeveloperAI2024" role="doc-biblioref">C. M. Hicks, Lee, and Foster-Marks 2024</a>)</span>. Broad reviews on drivers of software development outcomes, particularly frictions in the form of team “debt,” also suggest that social-psychological aspects of shared work processes may be a significant contributor to these outcomes separate from individual performance <span class="citation" data-cites="ahmadPandorasBoxSocial2024">(<a href="#ref-ahmadPandorasBoxSocial2024" role="doc-biblioref">Ahmad and Gustavsson 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite some recognition that the 10x engineer is a problematic concept, the conflictual measurement of productivity and its use as a tool of surveillance and punishment contra the interests of individual contributors (but to the benefit, at least ostensibly, to a company’s profitability) continues with full-throated glee. A recent unpublished study claims that nearly 10% of engineers contribute almost no work; that is to say, it raises the boogeyman of the 0.1x engineer as the 10x engineer’s inverse<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><span class="citation" data-cites="obstbaumOngoingResearchSoftware">(<a href="#ref-obstbaumOngoingResearchSoftware" role="doc-biblioref">Obstbaum and Denisov-Blanch, n.d.</a>)</span>. The measure of productivity used is something half-way between the objective and self-report: an unspecified machine-learning model trained on expert ratings of the quality and work necessary to complete 70 commits <span class="citation" data-cites="denisov-blanchPredictingExpertEvaluations2024">(<a href="#ref-denisov-blanchPredictingExpertEvaluations2024" role="doc-biblioref">Denisov-Blanch et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Unlike prior work, this method lacks both the transparency of “objective” measures and the temperance of self-report measures.</p>
<p>In taking a deep dive into cycle time, this project does not address every implementation challenge and organizational affordance that may define whether organizations can ensure a healthy and sustainable practice around the measurement of work activity. However, we believe that a more robust understanding of the dynamics of cycle time may help practitioners avoid pitfalls in relying on velocity measures while evaluating software work. We hope to describe the complexity in a way that at adds some clarity and aligns with the experience of software developers in practice.</p>

<p>Because lower cycle times typically indicate faster delivery times and more efficient software processes, cycle time has long been taken as a key indicator of team health, developer productivity, and team efficiency <span class="citation" data-cites="clincySoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2003 agrawalSoftwareEffortQuality2007 carmelCycleTimePackaged1995 eversImprovingEngineeringProductivity1998 guptaKeyDriversReduced1998 nanImpactBudgetSchedule2009 ruvimovaExploratoryStudyProductivity2022 sadowskiRethinkingProductivitySoftware2019 trendowiczChapter6Factors2009">(<a href="#ref-clincySoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2003" role="doc-biblioref">Clincy 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-agrawalSoftwareEffortQuality2007" role="doc-biblioref">Agrawal and Chari 2007</a>; <a href="#ref-carmelCycleTimePackaged1995" role="doc-biblioref">Carmel 1995</a>; <a href="#ref-eversImprovingEngineeringProductivity1998" role="doc-biblioref">Evers, Oehler, and Tucker 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-guptaKeyDriversReduced1998" role="doc-biblioref">Gupta and Souder 1998</a>; <a href="#ref-nanImpactBudgetSchedule2009" role="doc-biblioref">Nan and Harter 2009</a>; <a href="#ref-ruvimovaExploratoryStudyProductivity2022" role="doc-biblioref">Ruvimova et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-sadowskiRethinkingProductivitySoftware2019" role="doc-biblioref">Sadowski and Zimmermann 2019</a>; <a href="#ref-trendowiczChapter6Factors2009" role="doc-biblioref">Trendowicz and Münch 2009</a>)</span>. This suggests that understanding factors that influence cycle time may lead to insights into factors that are important to understand for understanding productivity in general. At minimum, examining cycle time can provide a description of the complexity of factors that impact this popular metric.</p>
<p>Cycle time examines one aspect of the speed of software delivery by measuring the time between task start and task delivery. It has consistently been described by industry research as one of the best and most trusted metrics for software productivity <span class="citation" data-cites="careyWhy70Engineers2024">(<a href="#ref-careyWhy70Engineers2024" role="doc-biblioref">Carey 2024</a>)</span>. In this same report, similar metrics also showed preference, such as lead time, deploy frequency, and change failure rate. The common thread across these metrics is that the unit of work is defined by the team or company in relation to goals that serve the strategic interests of the project. While there is a good deal of nuance with respect to what goes into setting these units up, they are both discrete (and so “objective”-feeling) but also defined, often collaboratively, with respect to the outcomes that matter. This is in contrast to lines of code, for example, which may or may not be relevant to the goals of the engineering teams, and which is avoided by 70% of respondents in the same industry report. Cycle time may also be considered an important part of developer experience as a component of what leads to a fluid-feeling development and release cycle <span class="citation" data-cites="greilerActionableFrameworkUnderstanding2022a">(<a href="#ref-greilerActionableFrameworkUnderstanding2022a" role="doc-biblioref">Greiler, Storey, and Noda 2022</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In calls to re-examine the complexity of developer productivity, researchers have argued that velocity measures are highly task-dependent, and do not represent the quality of work done or other, longer-term measures of the impact of work <span class="citation" data-cites="sadowskiSoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2019">(<a href="#ref-sadowskiSoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2019" role="doc-biblioref">Sadowski, Storey, and Feldt 2019</a>)</span>. It is also possible for velocity measures to have multiple directional relationships with desired outcomes depending on software developers’ larger context. For instance, hypothetically speaking, an increase in velocity may associate with more success for a software team when this increase arises because the team engages in process improvements, creating processes that help them to move more quickly through development tasks, and thereby meet a critical deadline for a product launch, leading to business outcomes which then lead to more resources for the team. However in a different scenario, an increase in velocity may be associated with more failures for a software team, for instance, if velocity changes arise because the team begins to eschew quality control processes, eventually leading to costly critical business failures.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, time and output-based measures are frequently used as an outcome measure to make recommendations for software engineering practices, e.g.&nbsp;in evaluating the perceived impact of technical debt <span class="citation" data-cites="beskerTechnicalDebtCripples2018">(<a href="#ref-beskerTechnicalDebtCripples2018" role="doc-biblioref">Besker, Martini, and Bosch 2018</a>)</span>. These measures have the added benefit of having a concrete referent that is simple to measure and inexpensive and convenient for teams trying to track productivity to collect.</p>
<p>The utility of cycle time has subsequently led to numerous industry experts recommending that engineering managers and leaders track their teams’ cycle times. However, leaders are provided less guidance on how to decrease cycle time. As such, leaders are left with the dilemma of being aware of their cycle times, but not understanding how to improve their cycle times in an evidence based way. Four major areas have been proposed to impact cycle time: (1) organizational structure and climate, (2) reward system, (3) software development process and (4) the use of software design and testing tools <span class="citation" data-cites="clincySoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2003">(<a href="#ref-clincySoftwareDevelopmentProductivity2003" role="doc-biblioref">Clincy 2003</a>)</span>. We focus in this paper on factors from (3) software development processes, in part because measurements of these processes continue to gather significant interest from the technology industry and are plausibly mobile levers that can be manipulated at the level of an engineering team. They are also themselves relatively easy to measure and track at the team level if a software team within a larger organization were to decide they wanted to try to shift their processes and take measurements to make sure they were successful. We have argued elsewhere that organizational structure and climate are also relatively easy to measure and are powerful levers that should be more often targeted <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksCumulativeCultureTheory2024 hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023 hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2024">(<a href="#ref-hicksCumulativeCultureTheory2024" role="doc-biblioref">C. M. Hicks and Hevesi 2024</a>; <a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023" role="doc-biblioref">C. Hicks, Lee, and Ramsey 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2024" role="doc-biblioref">C. M. Hicks, Lee, and Ramsey 2024</a>)</span>, though for the present work we focus on (3) also in part to keep the scope of this analysis manageable.</p>
<p>To reduce cycle times at the level of software development process, the software industry currently recommends strategies centered around three major themes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>increased coding time</li>
<li>improved task scoping</li>
<li>improved collaboration</li>
</ol>
<p>Industry convention rationalizes that increased coding times increases the amount of code committed and pull requests merged, thus moving tickets through their life cycle more quickly. Improved scoping can similarly yield more efficient teams by breaking work down into more manageable chunks and reducing the amount of unplanned work from bugs and defects. Finally, industry reports posit that improved collaboration can reduce the time it takes for developers to review PRs and increase review rates <span class="citation" data-cites="flowHowIncreaseSoftware gralhaReduceCycleTime2022 waydevCycleTimeFormula2021">(<a href="#ref-flowHowIncreaseSoftware" role="doc-biblioref">Flow, n.d.</a>; <a href="#ref-gralhaReduceCycleTime2022" role="doc-biblioref">Gralha 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-waydevCycleTimeFormula2021" role="doc-biblioref">Waydev 2021</a>)</span>. However, this has not yet been examined empirically. That is, although industry convention dictates that these practices work to reduce cycle time, we have yet to generate real world evidence of their effectiveness. We focus on these three areas as possible factors that impact cycle time.</p>

<p>To examine coding time, task scoping, and collaboration as predictors of cycle time over time, we centered our analysis on a large, real-world dataset of git and ticketing data of 55,619 observations across 12 months in 2022 from 11,398 users in 216 organizations of varying sizes and industries. We chose to use longitudinal data across 12 months, as it allowed us to examine fluctuations within a person’s workflow as well as different stable tendencies between people.This data was available via partnerships between a software metrics tool[^Formerly Pluralsight Flow, now Flow at Appfire. All authors were research scientists or data scientists employed at Pluralsight at the time that this data was collected and analyzed.] which was incorporated into the workflows of real working software teams, and the 216 organizations which opted in to this tool at any point during the 12 month analytic window. Notably, because this tool was adopted on an organizational level (following partnership agreements that include organizational opt-in and security audits), users themselves did not have to be active users of the software metrics tool itself in order to be included in this dataset, and git and ticketing data was available retrospectively for dates prior to the implementation of the tool in the organization. In other words, the git and ticketing data included in this analysis is not predicated on being an individual user of the software metrics tool, nor on the software metrics tool being used at the organization, as our dataset contains measures both before and after the software metric tool implementation at the organization, and implementation dates for organizations vary across the 12 month period.</p>
<p>Data were selected for analysis based on whether users actively contributed code during the time frame of the study. The 216 organizations included in this dataset had between 1–2,746 individuals in the dataset, with 90% of organizations being represented by more than 12 users, and in previous pilot surveys used to inform the design of this project, professional software developer users from these organizations described their main industries as ranging from Technology, Finance, Government, Insurance, Retail, and others, indicating a wide diversity of business use cases and engineering contexts were present in this sample.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="computing-study-variables"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Computing study variables</h2>
<p>Using the most complete data for each user, we used the mean to aggregate each variable at the <em>month</em> level and the <em>year</em> level (see below for more details specific to each variable). For each predictor, we then subtracted each person’s yearly average from their monthly data to produce a within-person deviation variable. This allowed us to disaggregate effects on the outcome due to yearly-level individual differences and within-person, month-to-month fluctuations <span class="citation" data-cites="curranDisaggregationPersonPerson2011">(<a href="#ref-curranDisaggregationPersonPerson2011" role="doc-biblioref">Curran and Bauer 2011</a>)</span>. This also allowed us to avoid averaging between-person and within-person differences into a single effect estimate. These effects can be different even in the sign of the effect, for example with a positive relationship between some time-invariant factor and the outcome of interest at the between-person level, and a negative relationship between the same factor measured across time and within-person variation over time. A common example that is highly relevant to most technical and knowledge workers is typing speed and errors. Imagine someone trying to type as fast as they can; it is obvious that they will make more errors the faster they type, evincing a negative association between speed and errors. However, if one simply measures the typing speed and error rate of many people, it should be clear that we would see that faster typists tend to make fewer errors, perhaps because of differences in typing experience. In this study, we want to be able to examine average differences between people’s cycle time aggregated at the year while also examining what is associated with cycle time deviations from that yearly trend month-to-month. All year-level individual differences variables were centered at their mean. Exceptions or addenda are mentioned below. See <a href="#tbl-variables" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a> for a brief list of variables.</p>

<p>This is the dependent variable in these analyses. After computing the cycle time for each closed ticket in seconds, we found the median cycle time for each month for each user using all tickets <em>opened</em> in that month. For example, a ticket opened on the 9th of April, and closed on the 3rd of May would contribute 2,246,400 seconds to the calculation of the median for April.</p>

<p>We were not able to observe the closing date for every ticket given our data collection cutoff of March 7, 2023, and so it is plausible that we underestimate the median cycle time in a way that depends in part on how many ticket closing times we do not observe. For this reason, we also computed the proportion of tickets opened in that month that had not been closed by the end of our data collection. For example, any ticket opened in April, 2022 but not closed by March 7, 2023 would count toward the proportion of unclosed tickets for that month. We transformed proportions from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((-\infty, \infty)\)</span> using the logistic quantile function (with minimum and maximum proportions forced to be .01 and .99 respectively). We use this in the regressions below as a control variable to adjust for this possibility.</p>

<p>We examined time in two ways: monthly and quarterly. Months were represented as numeric values (i.e.&nbsp;January = 1, February = 2) and centered at month 7, which allows us to interpret certain quantities like the intercept as the average cycle time in the middle of the year. Additionally, because quarters provide meaningful business cadences that may impact engineering work, for instance in that some organizations set quarterly goals at the beginning of each quarter and push to meet those goals at the end of each quarter and that key product deadlines may occur systematically toward the end of quarters, we accounted for any effects of quarterly cycles by using an indicator for the within-quarter month, centered at the middle of the quarter (e.g., -1 for the first month of the quarter, 0 for the middle month, and 1 for the last month of the quarter). This approach allowed us to capture a more stable and realistic trajectory of change over the course of the year.</p>

<p>To control for any influence of team size on cycle time, we compute each individual’s team size as the average size of all teams that individual belongs to as defined by individuals’ co-located activity data. Specifically, in the database used, an individual contributor is given membership in any team that they have worked in, and this is updated retroactively. For each individual, we find all teams that person is a member of, compute the size of that team, and then average across those team sizes if an individual is a member of multiple teams. As such, this number is a very rough indicator of the size of teams an individual tends to be a part of and is static across the year. This is a limitation of the database. This is then entered as an individually-varying continuous variable to control for some of the effect of team size on an individual’s cycle time.</p>

<p>We measured collaboration by calculating degree centrality. To evaluate degree centrality, a metric derived from network analysis, we employed a framework where developers were treated as nodes within the network, and their interactions in the form of Pull Requests (PRs) were regarded as connections. In other words, any contribution of code to the same pull request constituted a collaboration edge between developers. We normalized each centrality value by dividing by the total number of developers constituting the organizational network. The calculations were executed using the Python package Networkx <span class="citation" data-cites="SciPyProceedings_11">(<a href="#ref-SciPyProceedings_11" role="doc-biblioref">Hagberg, Schult, and Swart 2008</a>)</span>.

<p>We developed a model of monthly average ticket cycle time conditional on the following predictors: within-quarter month number, team size, proportion of unclosed tickets, month number, yearly means and month-level deviations for coding days per week, total merged PRs, defect ticket percentage, degree centrality, and comments per PR. Specifically, we modeled cycle time as distributed Weibull with two parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> (scale), and <em>k</em> (shape). The Weibull distribution is often used to model time-to-event data <span class="citation" data-cites="harrellRegressionModelingStrategies2015 rummelAverageWeibullAnalysis2017">(<a href="#ref-harrellRegressionModelingStrategies2015" role="doc-biblioref">Harrell 2015</a>; <a href="#ref-rummelAverageWeibullAnalysis2017" role="doc-biblioref">Rummel 2017</a>)</span>, where <em>k</em> determines the change over time in the probability of an event occurring (often called the “hazard rate”), and where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> determines the time-to-event for some proportion of the cases (or in other words, how spread out the distribution is). For simplicity, we assume that the shape (hazard rate, <em>k</em>) is not influenced by the factors considered, and focus on how these factors affect the scale (time-to-event, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) of ticket closures, though we did allow the shape, <em>k</em>, to vary across organizations. In short, the Weibull distribution provides flexibility for accurately describing cycle time data that tend to have a bulk of observations at the low end, with a very long tail of more extreme observations.</p>
<p>The model for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\log(\lambda) &amp;= X\beta + \eta_{\text{org}} + \eta_{\text{org:user}} \\
\eta_{\text{org}} &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\begin{bmatrix} \mu_1 \\ \mu_2 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{11} &amp; \sigma_{12} \\ \sigma_{21} &amp; \sigma_{22} \end{bmatrix}\right) \\
\eta_{\text{org:user}} &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}\left(\begin{bmatrix} \mu_3 \\ \mu_4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} \sigma_{33} &amp; \sigma_{34} \\ \sigma_{43} &amp; \sigma_{44} \end{bmatrix}\right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is the matrix of predictors, <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is the vector of coefficients, <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\text{org}}\)</span> is random intercepts with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and linear slopes of month with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> for each organization, and <span class="math inline">\(\eta_{\text{org:user}}\)</span> is random intercepts with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_3\)</span> and linear slopes of month with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_4\)</span> for each user nested within organization. The specific predictors in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are within-quarter month number, team size, proportion of unclosed tickets, month number, yearly means and month-level deviations for coding days per week, total merged PRs, defect ticket percentage, degree centrality, and comments per PR. We also include interactions between month number and the following: team size, proportion of unclosed tickets, and each of the yearly mean predictors. This allows us to account as completely as possible for our control variables (team size and proportion of unclosed tickets), and allow the effect of month on cycle time to vary by the individual differences variables (e.g., to account for the possibility that someone who has higher coding days per week shows a less steep decrease in cycle time across the year than someone with lower coding days per week).</p>
<p>The model for <em>k</em> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\log(k) &amp;= \zeta_{\text{org}} \\
\zeta_{\text{org}} &amp;\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_5, \sigma_{5})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\zeta_{\text{org}}\)</span> is a random intercept with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu_5\)</span> each organization.</p>
<p>Conceptually, this model allows a unique distribution of cycle times (as determined by the random intercepts for both <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <em>k</em>) for each organization. It also allows the scale of the distribution of cycle times to vary for each user due to the random intercept for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. The effect of time (month number) on the scale of the distribution of cycle times is also allowed to vary across organizations as well as users due to the random slopes (with means <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_4\)</span>). This strategy allows two advantages: first, we account for multiple sources of variance that allows our estimates of the effects of interest to be more precise; and second, we are able to provide estimates of this variation across organizations and users. This variation itself is of interest given the various myths mentioned in the introduction about developer performance.</p>
<p>We model the effect of proportion of unclosed tickets and month number as smooth functions of the covariate using thin-plate splines for increased flexibility <span class="citation" data-cites="woodGeneralizedAdditiveModels2017">(<a href="#ref-woodGeneralizedAdditiveModels2017" role="doc-biblioref">Wood 2017</a>)</span>. Briefly, thin plate splines (functions made up of smoothly connected segments) allow for flexible, non-linear relationships between predictors and the response variable. These splines are penalized to prevent overfitting, balancing model flexibility and complexity. The interactions between month number and our control variables are parameterized as additional smooth functions of month number multiplied by these variables. While our focal model parameterizes the interactions between year-level means and month number as linear coefficients on multiplicative combinations between the two variables, we also examined a model that uses additional smooth functions of month number multiplied by these variables to allow for additional complexity. We provide the model output for this sensitivity analysis in a supplement.</p>
<p>We set weakly-informative priors centered at zero for all parameters, except for the intercept for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> and <em>k</em> which were centered on their approximate values in the data (consistent with the default behavior of <code>brms</code>). We performed prior-predictive checks to ensure our prior specification generated data that covered and exceeded the space of our observations. Given the complexity of the model, we also specified initialization of parameters at small plausible values (e.g., zero for coefficients, .1 for standard deviations of random effects). Full prior and initialization specifications are available in the analysis code.</p>
<p>We sampled from 4 chains with 2,000 total iterations each, discarding the first 1,000 iterations as warmup. Inferences were made on 4,000 post-warmup draws from the posterior probability distribution from the 4 chains.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inferences"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Inferences</h2>
<p>We take a Bayesian approach to making claims about the sign of effects (i.e., whether an association between two variables is positive or negative), and to describing its magnitude. Instead of the common but fraught frequentist approach of describing whether an effect size is unlikely given the assumption of an unrealistic point-null hypothesis, we try to give the reader a sense of the actual probability that the sign of an effect is in a particular direction, and what the impact of the factor is on cycle times in terms that are easy to interpret <span class="citation" data-cites="GelmanPowerCalculationsAssessing2014">(<a href="#ref-GelmanPowerCalculationsAssessing2014" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman and Carlin 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In more precise statistical terms, unless otherwise stated we describe the posterior of parameters and predictions using the median of the distribution, and characterize its variation using the highest posterior density interval (HDI) which is defined as the interval that contains a specified percentage (usually 95%) of the most probable values of the parameter <span class="citation" data-cites="kruschkeRejectingAcceptingParameter2018">(<a href="#ref-kruschkeRejectingAcceptingParameter2018" role="doc-biblioref">Kruschke 2018</a>)</span>. We make general descriptive inferences based on the probability that a parameter has the sign of the posterior density’s median value. For example, if 80% of the posterior density of the slope of the effect of month on cycle time is of the same sign as the density’s median, and that median is negative, we would say something like, “given the model and the data, there is an 80% chance that there is a decrease in cycle times across the year.”</p>

<p>Results from the linear model reported below were highly similar to those in the more flexible non-linear model sensitivity analysis described above. Also note that parameters in the table are from a linear model for the distribution of log(<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>) and log(<em>k</em>), while model expectations are on the response scale and can therefore display curvature even while the model is linear.</p>
<p>The first section of the results concerns the population-level effects and showcases the expectations of cycle time conditional on the various co-varying factors we target. The second section explores the variability in these effects across time, across individuals, and across organizations.</p>

<p>We find that all measured factors, both individual-difference and within-person deviations, have a non-zero association with cycle time, with 100% of the posterior distribution for these parameters sharing the same sign (see <a href="#tbl-results-fe" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> for point estimates and uncertainty intervals). Within-quarter month showed a very small (relative to other effects shown below) negative association with cycle time, indicating that time to ticket completion is shorter at the end of quarters (<a href="#fig-quarter" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). Team size had almost to no effect on cycle time (<a href="#tbl-results-fe" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>). Cycle times tended to decrease slightly over the year (<a href="#fig-month" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). The proportion of unclosed tickets, an important control variable, on average had close to no effect on our measure of average monthly cycle time but interacted with month.</p>

<p>Specifically, when individuals increased average coding days per week month-to-month they also tended to have lower cycle times, and individuals with more average coding days per week across the year tended to have lower cycle times (<a href="#fig-codingdays" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a>).

<p>The percent of defect tickets showed a negative association with cycle time for within-person deviations and a positive association for individual differences. In other words, individuals who tended to have more defect tickets as a proportion of their work across the course of the year also tended to have longer cycle times. However, for any given person, an increase in the proportion of defect tickets in a month was associated with lower cycle times (<a href="#fig-defecttickets" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>). The interaction with month number for this effect was centered close to zero, with only 78% of the posterior in the negative direction with a fairly narrow distribution around zero (95% HDI = [-0.0003, 0.0001]).</p>

<p>Degree centrality, both on average across the year individual differences and within-person deviations, showed a negative association with cycle time (<a href="#fig-degree" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;6</a>). In other words, individuals who on average contribute code to PRs that have a lot of other contributors tend to have lower cycle times for tickets they own. Similarly, when individuals’ collaboration on PRs increases in a given month, their cycle time tends to go down. This effect does not unambiguously strengthen or weaken across the year with 71% of the posterior for the interaction effect having negative sign with a fairly narrow distribution around zero (95% HDI = [-0.0005, 0.0002]).</p>

<p>Finally, the number of comments per PR showed a positive association with cycle time. Individuals who tended to garner more comments on their PRs also tended to have higher cycle times, and within a given month, a higher number of comments per PR relative to a person’s average was also associated with higher cycle times (<a href="#fig-comments" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>). This effect also does not unambiguously strengthen or weaken across the year with 59% of the posterior for the interaction effect having negative sign with a fairly narrow distribution around zero (95% HDI = [-0.0004, 0.0005]).</p>

<p>Given the inherent non-linearity of the Weibull distribution, the effects of the predictors on cycle time are not constant across the range of the data. For example, the expected difference in cycle-time for a unit difference for within-person coding days per week will be different at different times of the year simply as a by-product that we are modeling the log of the scale parameter. Notice that this is true even in the absence of interactive effects, which further complicate the interpretation of the effect sizes for the year-average variables. Indeed, the random effects which allow intercept and month-effect variance both organizations and individuals also adds to the complexity of interpreting the effect sizes.</p>
<p>To give the reader a sense for how these associations play out across organizations, we plot a range of expected changes in cycle time given a counterfactual change from the 50th percentile to the 90th percentile on the variable of interest, all else held equal (<a href="#fig-heatmaps" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a>). We do this for each organization, for each month, and then plot these as a heatmap where the color represents the expected change in cycle time. This allows us to see how the effect of a variable on cycle time changes across organizations and across time.</p>

Figure&nbsp;8: Effect sizes for each variable are heterogeneous across time, organizations, and values of other predictors. These plots show the expected change in cycle time from 50th to 90th percentile of each variable, by organization and month. The color represents the expected change in cycle time, with warm indicating an increase in cycle time and cool indicating a decrease. The scale is the same across all plots.

<p>There is heterogeneity in the distribution of cycle time across organizations in both the scale and shape parameters, which suggests that comparisons of cycle time trends between teams across different organizations may be difficult and should include careful approaches that take into account this variation (<a href="#tbl-results-re" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>). This can be seen visually as differences in the posterior predictive distribution of cycle times across organizations especially when viewed on a log scale to emphasize differences at the low end of cycle times where the distribution tends to be most dense (<a href="#fig-pp-check-org" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;9</a>). Different organizations likely have different guidelines and cultures around using tickets and this may show up as this kind of heterogeneity in cycle time. Incidentally we can also see, looking across the full data-set, that the posterior distribution of our model captures well our data distribution (<a href="#fig-pp-check-sum" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;10</a>).</p>

<p>Variation across individuals’ scale parameter after accounting for organization heterogeneity is also substantial, and greater in magnitude than organizational heterogeneity (sd = 0.65 [0.63, 0.66] versus sd = 0.47 [0.42, 0.53]; <a href="#tbl-results-re" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>). There is also notable heterogeneity in the effect of month both at the organization level and the level of individuals. There is a small negative correlation between individuals’ (and less credibly, organizations’) scale intercepts and the effect of month meaning that a person who has a higher cycle time at month 7 also tends to decrease more steeply in their cycle time across the year (<a href="#tbl-results-re" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;3</a>).</p>
<p>We also examine the variability around our population effects. <a href="#fig-bw-ct-traj" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;11</a> shows model-expected cycle-time trajectories across the year for randomly-sampled individuals. One of the stronger effects at the population-level is the effect of the average number of coding-days-per-week (both averaged over the year, and month by month). To begin, we examine the effect of year-average coding-days-per-week. We split the sampled individuals into 5%-wide quantiles based on their yearly average coding days per week. The population-level effect discussed above reveals that, on average, individuals who have more coding-days-per-week also tend to have lower cycle times. This shows up subtly in Figure 9 as a decline in cycle-time from left-to-right across these quantiles, especially when examining the amount to which the trajectories occur below the thick black median-cycle-time line.</p>

<p>What is important about this illustration when interpreting these results in the context of a real software development team is that it shows a single measurement for a person on any given day or even averaged across a month may not be representative of that individual’s long-term trend. While some of this uncertainty reflects measurement error, much of it is irreducible given the factors we’ve considered in this analysis. It may be possible to reduce it by adding further information to the model. However, at present the conclusion must be that one must take great care in comparing cycle-time between individuals even in the same organization, or even against themselves.</p>
<p>We can also examine the effect of month-by-month deviations in coding-days-per-week at the level of these example individuals. <a href="#fig-wi-ct-traj" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;12</a> shows data for the same quantiles as above, but now cycle time is normalized around each person’s median to better visualize within-person deviations in cycle time. Again, across the year we see that variation within-person is substantial. While we can see the tendency for within-person increases and decreases in average-coding-days-per-week to affect cycle time, there is considerable variation still, with many yellow-colored points above the 0 line and darker points below the zero line.</p>

<p>We can unpack this variability further with the help of our model. We will again examine a random subset of 10 participants with complete data across the year. Again, each one is sampled from a different bin of values of one of our strongest predictors, year-average average-coding-days-per-week. <a href="#fig-ct-pp-traj" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a> (left) shows the model-expected central tendency (gloss as a sort of moving-average) of each of these participants, along with their observed data. We can also ask the model to generate plausible values for cycle time that we might observe; these are the gray lines behind everything. What is clear here is that there is some systematic effect on the central tendency for different levels of year-average coding days. Again, we see a lot of overlap across individuals. And when we examine both the observed data, and the model predictions, we see a whole lot more overlap.</p>
<p>The next thing we can do with the model is ask it to give us these expectations and predictions under the counterfactual condition of each of these participants having a different number of year-average coding days. This is just a simulation, not an experiment, so we should heed this caveat. In <a href="#fig-ct-pp-traj" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;13</a> (right), we see model expectations and posterior predictions were each of these participants induced to take on the yearly-average number of coding days from the 10th, 50th, and 90th quantile of our data. This is a huge spread, but we see only small, incremental changes in the model expectations for each of them. More importantly, the spread of the posterior predictions, binned for ease of visualization in the pixels behind the expectation lines, are nearly indistinguishable. Taken together, these results once again suggest caution in the use of this highly variable software metric: taking a relatively unsophisticated monthly average of an individual developer’s cycle time data is not likely to be able to tell you what their cycle time will be like in the future. This further suggests that future work investigating the impact of interventions on factors that impact cycle time may expect to see relatively small or even invisible changes at the individual level, even when inducing changes that do scale to desired impact at the organizational level.</p>

<section id="limitations" class="level1" data-number="5">
<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Limitations</h1>
<p>Throughout the results, we have included commentary on the larger context of software work and associated cautions regarding the interpretation of our findings. In the following discussion section, we further elaborate on future research directions which may build on the evidence in the current paper. As noted in the introduction, there are many limitations to the usage of an output-based velocity metric, including that such a metric does not capture business outcomes, the quality of task performance, and perceived value of software development work. Nevertheless, monitoring cycle time is frequently recommended as a measurement practice for software management. Below, we elaborate on four key limitations of the current findings in greater detail, which are of course also opportunities for future research.</p>
<p>First, measurement validity challenges in ticket data and sample representativeness constrain our analysis. A primary contribution of this paper is to present findings from the analysis of a large (more than 55k observations across 216 organizations) and longitudinal (a calendar year) dataset of software work activity data. Metrics which are git-based can enhance the measurement validity of our project by providing this large-scale observation, unfiltered by individual perception, in the ecologically valid context of real working teams. Nevertheless, measurement validity may also be threatened by the way that data are defined and constructed in the process leading to the creation of variables around tickets: for instance, we rely on a general assumption that teams mark tickets in a fairly accurate and timely manner. Our dataset lacked contextual information that could serve to validate team practices around ticket entry, and while we sought to align our assumptions with known practices around these ticketing tools and software workflows, it is important to note that differences in the timeliness and accuracy of ticket entries may be an important factor complicating our ability to understand cycle time. This context limitation also applies to our sample of organizations which is non-random and reflects organizations that invested in the software metrics tool that provided that data.</p>
<p>Second, systematic differences in ticket assignment patterns may complicate cycle time interpretations. In this analysis, we have primarily explored cycle time as derived from a tickets-based metric. However, how a ticket and its associated work tasks are assigned inside of an organization is likely an important factor in how tickets are completed. Assignment of tickets, especially defect tickets, is complex over time and both the initial and subsequent assignments of tickets can be impacted by many factors. For example, after an initial assignment to a developer, bugs may frequently be reassigned due to diverse factors such as determining ownership, time constraints, and identifying developers who may have a particular view into the root cause of the bug <span class="citation" data-cites="guoNotMyBug2011">(<a href="#ref-guoNotMyBug2011" role="doc-biblioref">Guo et al. 2011</a>)</span>. Some individuals may get assigned defect tickets systematically more often than others, and changes in the proportion of work that consists of defect tickets may change how fast someone is able to work in general, either because defect tickets tend to be larger or smaller in scope than other tickets, or because of disruptions.</p>
<p>Third, our simplified measurement of team structures fails to capture the complex collaborative reality of software development. In this analysis, given limitations in our dataset about contexts such as internal team structures within organizations, we have explored team size with a generous attribution of team belonging across shared activity, which almost certainly represents a very rough estimate of team size. We have also calculated team size as averaged in a static measure for the entire year, rather than captured over time. Given that team size likely impacts how quickly work is completed, we may miss out on nuanced effects here; for instance, it is reasonable to imagine that further variables around how resources are distributed and allocated to teams may provide further predictive value to our understanding of team-level factors that change cycle time. Team “assignment” itself is also highly complex in technical work, as cross-team collaboration is typical, and collaborations across software projects may frequently not match explicit organizational hierarchies. In our previous research using self-reports from software teams, we have found that over 60% of individual contributors on software teams report working closely with other individual collaborators who do not share their same manager <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023">(<a href="#ref-hicksDeveloperThrivingFour2023" role="doc-biblioref">C. Hicks, Lee, and Ramsey 2023</a>)</span>. In short, software development is a collaborative exercise that is embedded in an ecosystem with history and many actors <span class="citation" data-cites="hicksCumulativeCultureTheory2024">(<a href="#ref-hicksCumulativeCultureTheory2024" role="doc-biblioref">C. M. Hicks and Hevesi 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fourth, invisible collaborative activities and contributor role ambiguity limit interpretations of cycle time variations. Developers communicate and collaborate in many ways that may not be captured in a ticket, e.g.&nbsp;impromptu or formal mentorship, paired or mob programming, and planning meetings. Where activity data are collected for some of these activities, it is likely that such data may be perceived in our data collection as “belonging” to a single individual, but work may often reflect joint work (e.g., in the case of mentorship, paired, and planning activities where one developers “logs” the work of many). These organizational communication activities and social norms may provide informative context for interpreting cycle time activities. For instance, organizational planning data may provide a useful next step in understanding how planning meetings do or do not cause downstream cycle time to progress more efficiently. Also many people that work on software may not be represented in this ticketing data. We also do not know for certain the job titles of each contributor to this dataset and use the term software developer broadly.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="take-aways-for-practitioners-and-anti-patterns"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Take-aways for practitioners and Anti Patterns</h2>
<p>In this section, we summarize parts of our more thorough discussion (below) in plain language that we hope will be useful for software practitioners, highlighting not only the evidence at hand, but also cautionary anti-patterns we think may be likely when using cycle time data at scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>We observe many robust influences on cycle time but with small effects. This means implementing a change targeting any one of these factors may help a little bit, but don’t expect a magic bullet. We recommend that practitioners consider the trade-offs of implementing any particular change by incorporating more context about developers’ work tasks that goes beyond activity data, as well as designing an iterative, experimental approach to evaluating changes that includes measures that go beyond cycle time, such as incorporating developers’ self-report on the utility of measurement practices.</li>
<li>Any single observation of cycle time is a very noisy indication of what is typical. Again, remember that each ticket’s time-to-close is influenced by myriad factors, most of which are beyond the individual contributor’s control. Ensuring a standard and repeatable practice around how tickets are created and managed across teams may also be a necessary precondition to relying on ticket data to make valid comparisons.</li>
<li>Practitioners can use this research to feel justified in seeking more shared and environmental explanations for the speed of work while doing complex software development, rather than locating their explanations in individual blame, or praise.</li>
<li>We can start to build up a sense of cycle times for teams and individuals if we are willing to observe patiently over long periods of time. Since we rarely observe identical task repetition, we need more observations to establish “typical” performance and identify factors that influence cycle time. Similar to public health research, understanding software work requires studying diverse contexts across industries and companies. This broad scope also creates opportunities for natural experiments. While organizations may hesitate to share data, these “secrets” typically diffuse naturally, and free revealing may ultimately prove more profitable, as described by <span class="citation" data-cites="vonhippelFreeRevealingPrivatecollective2006">Von Hippel and Von Krogh (<a href="#ref-vonhippelFreeRevealingPrivatecollective2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>.</li>
<li>We should understand that cycle time is still quite distant from the ultimate objective: efficient delivery of value in a context that supports those who produce that value.</li>
<li>Although we did not have self-report data from individual contributors in the context of this analysis, it is possible that their perceptions and experience of doing software work gives them an accurate sense of what can help or hinder their problem solving. The measurement and attempt to change any particular objective indicator of software work, such as cycle time, should happen in conversation with these experts.</li>
<li>If you collect your own data on this, be aware that sometimes data can be too noisy to draw any credible conclusions. That in itself is a signal you can use to improve how and what you measure. At the end of the day, software development problem-solving is a social, human activity, and these are notoriously complex.</li>

<p>Our analyses revealed precise directional associations between the factors of interest and cycle time, though the magnitude of these effects warrants careful consideration. These effects were generally in an intuitive direction for coding time, task scoping, and collaboration. More coding days, both on average across the year (between-person), and month-to-month variations from that average (within-person) was associated with lower cycle times. Moreover, the effect of average coding days on cycle-time had a larger effect later in the year. Having more merged PRs both on average, and month-to-month was also associated with lower cycle-time. Greater collaboration at both the between- and within-person level, and as measured by shared work on the same pull request (and operationalized as degree centrality), were associated with lower cycle-times as well. Two main results will require more nuance in their interpretation. The effect of task scoping as measured by defect tickets (where a lower percentage of defect tickets, representing unplanned work, was taken as better task scoping) was associated with faster cycle times at the within-person level and greater cycle times at the between-person level. Finally, collaboration as measured by comments-per-PR was associated with longer cycle times. These main effects, while quite precise, were also somewhat small, and are set against a backdrop of substantial unexplained between- and within-person variation. This suggests that while there are a number of factors that do push around cycle-time, each the life cycle of each ticket is a complex function that is not necessarily captured by the metrics we have available, some of which are quite commonly recommended as important inputs to cycle time.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising that cycle time benefits when individuals have more time to code, either as a deviation from their usual, or than other people doing similar work. When task completion requires writing code, more time to code will obviously decrease time until completion. Similarly, being able to break work into more discrete chunks and completing more of these chunks should also benefit cycle time. Keep in mind that these results both control for the other. That is, this is the effect of more PRs for the same amount of coding time, and vice versa (we discuss this benefit of our modeling approach more below).</p>
<p>Perhaps not as obviously, contributing code to a PR that is being contributed by others (what is captured by our degree centrality measure) also benefits cycle time. Contrary to the possibility that there are too many cooks in the kitchen, we show that on average cycle time is lower when people work together on a shared problem. Again, this is all-else-equal controlling for coding time, total PRs, and the other variables in our model. However, we must also consider that more comments per PR is associated with higher cycle time. This is another signal of coordination and collaboration, but has an opposite effect. Although speculative, we think that this reflects cases where a particular PR is attempting to solve a difficult problem, and where discussion is needed. Of course, this may also be a signal that communication can sometimes become problematic. Future work would have to examine the content of the PR and communication to disambiguate these possibilities as well as others.</p>
<p>To finish our preliminary discussion of the main effects, we consider the effect of defect tickets. Individuals with a higher proportion of defect tickets on average over the course of the year tend to also have longer cycle times, while a person who suddenly has more defect tickets in a given month tends to have lower cycle times that month. We speculate that the between-person effect may be a result of different roles: in other words, people whose general workload is bug squashing may simply be given more difficult bugs to squash; alternatively, if less experienced programmers are generally given more bugs as a share of work, they may be slower at completing their tasks. Organizational factors may also be a culprit: if one’s work is, on average over the course of a year, swamped by defect tickets, one doesn’t have time to complete other tasks.</p>
<p>Considering the association of lower cycle-times during months when a person tends to have more defect tickets, we speculate that this may be a result of a shift in work from larger pieces of generative work to fixing a lot of small errors. Again, as is the case with the between-person effect here, and with the effect of comments per PR above, these results suggest that a holistic and diagnostic approach to understanding cycle time changes and their relationship to tickets would need to include measures of the content of tickets (and context around ticket assignment) in a more granular way than was possible within the scope of this project.</p>
<p>The substantial individual differences observed in our analysis, coupled with considerable residual variance after accounting for all measured factors, presents both methodological and practical implications for the assessment of software work. This heterogeneity in software metrics suggests that detecting the impact of specific interventions on cycle time may prove challenging unless the effect size substantially exceeds the natural variation in individual and team performance. The magnitude of unexplained variance serves as a crucial caveat for practitioners and researchers attempting to implement and evaluate software work interventions in software development contexts.</p>
<p>The observed variability itself constitutes a meaningful signal that resonates with the lived experience of software development practitioners. Our findings suggest that there exists no universal formula for optimizing cycle time or enhancing software work across all contexts and individuals. Rather, the path toward improved development efficiency likely requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges this inherent variability while simultaneously pursuing refined measurement methodologies and targeted interventions. Success in this domain may depend on our ability to identify and mitigate confounding factors while developing increasingly sophisticated metrics that capture the complexity of software development processes.</p>
<p>Indeed, the amount of variability apparent in these ticket data is likely the result of the complexity of each unit of work in software development. The process of setting a particular goal, and then of planning how to reach that goal by breaking the work into discrete tickets and tasks, is itself both conceptually and socially complex, and may impact cycle-time. Moreover, the preconditions set by previous work on a codebase determines what a software developer is able to do to reach a particular goal and close a ticket. The discussion of the process of ticket assignment in the limitations, above, is also relevant here. Though crucially important as inputs to software work, these sources of variability are not often measured and may be considered by some to be immeasurable.</p>
<p>This work shows some clear signals about what might get in the way of closing tickets. Developers may lack enough time for coding, may not have enough collaborators, or may be bogged down with defect tickets. These are not necessarily factors individual contributors (ICs) have any control over. Again, the agency that any one person has to meaningfully alter cycle-time is likely limited. This points toward the need for systems-level thinking at the level of teams, units, organizations, and interactions between these elements over time, rather than models which only measure interventions on particular ICs in snapshots at a single point in time.</p>
<p>What about the individual? Many practitioners reading this will wonder what this means for their own productivity, or that of their direct reports. Is cycle-time a good way to measure productivity? Can I just give my team an extra head-down coding day and boost productivity? We think that some of these signals are straightforward and will likely help. As is often the case, more research is necessary. Testing actual changes (i.e., interventions) with good measurement would help us figure this out. However, for any one person, the effect on cycle-time will likely be small and hard to see unless one is taking careful data over a long period of time. That is perhaps the strongest message this research sends to the practitioner: cycle-time is a very poor-resolution tool for taking a snapshot of software work velocity because there are so many inputs that go into the time it takes to close a particular ticket. Resolution increases with more measurements across time, and across people. As we refine our measures of software work velocity it may be possible to make inferences about individuals in shorter time-scales but we do not know of a measure with such properties and the present work very strongly shows that cycle-time, as useful as it is, and as much as it can tell us in the aggregate, is not such a measure. One practical take-away for a practitioner may in fact be to feel justified in seeking more shared and environmental explanations for the speed of work while doing complex software development, rather than locating their explanations in individual blame, or praise.</p>
<p>The present work demonstrates numerous methodological strengths that also reveal ways in which inferences can be biased when data complexities are not accounted for. This is important to understand both for research like the current report but also for teams and organizations modeling their data internally. Primarily, the analyses presented here appropriately model cycle-time as Weibull-distributed. This is a probability distribution that has a lower bound at 0, and no upper bound. The distribution’s shape parameter characterizes the temporal dynamics of ticket closure probability (whether tickets become more or less likely to close as time passes), while the scale parameter (our focus in these analyses) determines the typical time window in which tickets tend to close. The shape of observed cycle-times, with the majority clustering around the low end but with a long right tail, is well described by this distribution. The more common Gaussian (normal) distribution has support on all real numbers (i.e., assumes negative cycle-times are plausible!), and the bulk of the distribution is centered symmetrically about the mean. Attempting to represent the influence of various factors on cycle-time data using an inappropriate distribution will have unintended consequences on the observed relationships, which may be biased, and can lead to mode predictions outside the range of possible values <span class="citation" data-cites="collettModellingSurvivalData1994 lawlessStatisticalModelsMethods2003 mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020 nelsonAppliedLifeData1982">(<a href="#ref-collettModellingSurvivalData1994" role="doc-biblioref">Collett 1994</a>; <a href="#ref-lawlessStatisticalModelsMethods2003" role="doc-biblioref">Lawless 2003</a>; <a href="#ref-mcelreathStatisticalRethinkingBayesian2020" role="doc-biblioref">McElreath 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-nelsonAppliedLifeData1982" role="doc-biblioref">Nelson 1982</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another strength that is relevant to both researchers and practitioners is the inclusion, simultaneously, of multiple factors in the same models. Splitting the data into groups using some factor like coding days and taking the average cycle time for each group, as a basis for making inferences about differences between groups, is not sufficient to account for the possibility that other factors systematically differ between those groups. Nevertheless, this is an approach which we have frequently seen in the industry. Modeling these factors simultaneously as continuous variables allows us to get closer to the idea of “X has an effect on Y, all else being held equal.” This is necessary for starting to figure out the effect of a particular factor in isolation. Of course, if one has access to even more sophisticated observational-causal-inference methods (e.g., natural experiments, or matching) or even interventional approaches, these would be even better. If this sounds a little bit difficult, it’s because, like many things in software development, it is. There’s no free lunch; and there are no solutions, only tradeoffs. If one wants easy quantitative answers, one must be willing to trade-off accuracy (and we almost never can say how much accuracy is lost until we do it the hard way too).</p>
<p>We have emphasized in this work the small size of these observed associations, and the vast variability in the outcome of interest. This may belie the utility of what can be gained by further investigation into these constructs. What we cannot know from this work is what a change in one of our workplace factors would really mean for cycle time, and what that might mean for an organization. We also have not yet emphasized how small effects can accumulate if sustained. For example, the 50th and 90th percentile in year-average average-coding-days-per-week is about 1 day. If we look at the model-expected association with an increase of 1 coding day per week, we reduce cycle time by roughly 2 days (compared to a raw median of 13 days; <a href="#fig-heatmaps" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;8</a>). Across an entire organization, this average may mean a lot. It is also worth noting that in the software literature, developers have reported substantial social-psychological benefits from increases to focus time, deep work, and days spent coding that may provide real and meaningful impacts on the quality of software work whether or not they result in cycle time change <span class="citation" data-cites="meyerTodayWasGood2021">(<a href="#ref-meyerTodayWasGood2021" role="doc-biblioref">Meyer et al. 2021</a>)</span>. As the findings of the current work have demonstrated, moving toward a greater understanding of how to improve software development will likely require a plurality of methods, measurements, and thoughtful experimental practices within software engineering organizations, rather than silver bullet, isolated metrics.</p>

<p>Looking forward, our findings suggest two primary directions for future research. In the domain of observational studies, increased attention to a ticket’s lifecycle, and process analysis appears. There are a number of measurable properties of tickets and code contributions that would be useful for distinguishing between different kinds of work and different interactions. For example, determining the expected scope or difficulty of tickets would allow for important statistical control, ensuring we compare like with like. Different kinds of work may also show different pitfalls and benefits, and could plausibly be determined from the content of a ticket or by assignment by those creating the tickets (for example, not all tickets will have a programming solution). Understanding and quantifying the type of content in PR comments would be useful in determining the causes and consequences of this avenue for collaboration. Ticket scope may also be contrasted with the ultimate complexity of the work that closes that ticket. Because of the creative and complex nature of software development, understanding what gets it stuck and what helps it flow will almost certainly have to wrestle with this complexity.</p>
